Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"stateVariables\":{\"_initialized\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\"},\"_initializing\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":\"Initializable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"istanbul\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x372b0bc04e3b4c074559bbbfb1317afddb56de5504158ca25a7f9cd403980445\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://88b812365459a042c2aab5c689ff723098e0e19cb372718d3dd028b3c406e4f6\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmTsLrMYzPjnB85pyAy85NNcBg64RPVueJARzwNg9xMyR1\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/AddressUpgradeable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x55cf2bd9fc76704ddcdc19834cd288b7de00fc0f298a40ea16a954ae8991db2d\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://37e4df53c8d2e3c1062c1c7b2c17366db7de03bfd2559d340ca95c588aa49c2f\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmQ9vsG3o4wED3FRogiSUhdzJvZSjjYFtydzXvFEJtgZk4\"]}},\"version\":1}",
